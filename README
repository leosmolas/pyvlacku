pyvlacku

I'm creating this dictionary, in order to have one fully linked, and with a better formatting, than the one that is automatically created in jbovlaste.

In order to do that, I'm developing a python script that receives an xml (you can export this in jbovlaste) and parses it, making a LaTeX file.

In the folder "latextemplates" I put the first approches to the .tex file. In "pysrc", there are some .py files with the program, and a .tex, that would be like the one in the other folder.

This proyect (software) is under GPL v3. All the words are in Public Domain, so the dictionary itself is in Public Domain.
