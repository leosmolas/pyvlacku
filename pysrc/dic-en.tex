\chapter*{How to use this dictionary}
\label{cha:howto}
In the chapter \textbf{Lojban - English}, you will find the list of all the \textsl{valsi}, in alphabetical order. It will be look like:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.55\textwidth}
	\dictchar{cy.}
	\dictentry{ce}{/she/}{c}{\textit{cec}\\\textbf{JOI}} %cambiar!!!
 	{}{}{}{non-logical connective: set link, unordered; "and also", but forming a set.}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

In the left column, you can find the \textsl{valsi} that is being defined. It will be followed by a letter, that stands for the type of the word, as in this list:

\begin{tabular}{ l l }
  \textit{g} & \textbf{\emph{gismu}}  \\
  \textit{f} & \textbf{\emph{fu'ivla}}  \\
  \textit{l} & \textbf{\emph{lujvo}}  \\
  \textit{c} & \textbf{\emph{cmavo}} \\
  \textit{n} & \textbf{\emph{cmene}} \\
  \textit{cc} & \textbf{\emph{cmavo cluster}} \\
  \textit{eg} & \textbf{\emph{experimental gismu}} \\
\end{tabular}

Below the \textsl{valsi}, in between slashes (``/'') you will find the word pronunciation, in the \textbf{IPA} representation. After it, in \textit{italics}, can appear the \textsl{rafsi} associated with the \textsl{valsi}. If the word is a \textsl{cmavo} or a \textsl{cmavo cluster}, it can appear in \textbf{bold}, the \textsl{selma'o} that the \textsl{valsi} belongs to.

In the right column, you will find the definition in English, with its \textbf{place structure}. Below it, in \textit{italics}, can appear a comment about the word.

You can change the book, as long as it remains in an open licence, but it's going to be difficult, since it's a .pdf. You can find the source code of this book(\texttt{.tex}) at \url{http://github.com/leosmolas/pyvlacku/tree/master/pysrc/}. 

But you might want to know how I created this. That lead us to the next section.
